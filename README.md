# GlucoPredictor ü©∫üìä

**GlucoPredictor** is a web-based diabetes risk assessment and data entry system designed to help users evaluate and monitor their potential risk for diabetes. The system allows users to perform diabetes risk assessments, obtain risk assessments results, and track their glucose levels, insulin usage, and weight, while providing personalized rule and AI-based health tips using a trained XGBoost model and educational insights about diabetes.

**Note:** Some portions of this code were developed with assistance from AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT). All AI-generated content has been reviewed and adapted by the developer to ensure accuracy and suitability for the project.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

  - **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap & JavaScript
  - **Backend**: PHP
  - **Machine Learning**: XGBoost (Python)
  - **Database**: MySQL (phpMyAdmin)
  - **Server**: Apache (XAMPP for local hosting)



## üß™ How It Works

1. **User Registration & Login**:
     - Users can sign up, activate their accounts via email and log in to access the system.
     - Admin users can manage other users.
   
2. **Data Input**:
     - Users input information such as age, gender, number of pregnancies, weight, height, family history, high blood pressure diagnosis, activity level, sugar consumption & symptoms on the `form.php` page.
     - Users can input information glucose levels, insulin intake & weight on the `glucose.php`, `weight.php` & `insulin.php` tracking pages to monitor them visually with a chart or table if desired.
   
3. **Risk Calculation**:
     - Risk is calculated using predefined rules via JavaScript and an AI model [`predict.py`] based on the risk assessment form input details and displayed on the `result.php` page.
   
4. **Health Tips**:
     - Based on the obtained risk assessment result, users receive personalized rule & AI-based health tips on the `tips.php` page.
   
5. **Risk Score History Tracking**:
     - Users can view their stored risk score history on the `history.php` page.



## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Follow these steps to set up **GlucoPredictor** on your local machine:


1. **Install Required Software**

    - [**XAMPP**](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) ‚Äì to run Apache & MySQL locally.
  
    - [**Python 3**](https://www.python.org/downloads/) ‚Äì for running the AI model.
   
    - [**Composer**](https://getcomposer.org/download/) ‚Äì to install PHP dependencies like PHPMailer for account activation, email verification and reset password.
  
    - [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/downloads) ‚Äì to clone the repository (optional).



3. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GlucoPredictor.git
    ```
   

4. **Set Up the Database**:
    - Open XAMPP Control Panel and start Apache & MySQL.
  
    - Go to http://localhost/phpmyadmin.
  
    - Create a new database named: glucopredictor
  
    - Import the SQL file (glucopredictor.sql) if available:
  
    - Click on the new database
  
    - Go to the Import tab
  
    - Upload and execute the .sql file



4. **Configure Database Connection**:
    - In any PHP files that connect to the database (e.g., form.php, login.php), ensure your database credentials are correct:
  
      ```bash
      $conn = new mysqli("localhost", "root", "", "glucopredictor");
      ```
  
    - If your MySQL password is not empty, update it accordingly.


5. **Install Composer Dependencies (PHPMailer)**:
    - GlucoPredictor uses PHPMailer for sending email verification and activating accounts.
    
    - Make sure Composer is installed:
       [**Download Composer**](https://getcomposer.org/download/)

    - Open your terminal (CMD or Bash) and navigate to your project directory:

      ```bash
      cd C:\xampp\htdocs\glucopredictor
      ```
    - Run the following command to install PHPMailer:

      ```bash
      composer require phpmailer/phpmailer
      ```
      
    - The PHPMailer files will be downloaded into the vendor/ directory.

    - Make sure to include the Composer autoload in any file that uses PHPMailer:
    
      ```bash
      require 'vendor/autoload.php';
      ```

6. **Set Up the Python Environment (AI Model)**:
    - Open Command Prompt or Terminal.
  
    - Navigate to the ml/ folder:
  
      ```bash
      cd C:\xampp\htdocs\glucopredictor\ml
      ```
  
    - Install the required Python libraries:
  
      ```bash
      pip install xgboost numpy
      ```
  
    - Make sure the following files are present:
  
      - predict.py
    
      - xgboost_diabetes_model.json

    - These are used to run the AI-based prediction.
